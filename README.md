# RFM Analysis of Sales Data Project <br>

Welcome to the RFM Analysis of Sales Data Project! This project focuses on applying RFM analysis techniques to sales data using Microsoft SQL Server. RFM analysis is a powerful tool for understanding customer behavior, segmenting customers, and making data-driven marketing and business decisions. <br>

# Project Goals : <br>

**Data Preparation**: Gather and preprocess sales data from various sources, ensuring data quality and consistency. <br>

**RFM Calculation**: Calculate RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for each customer in the dataset. <br>

**Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers into meaningful groups based on their RFM scores to identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers. <br>

**Data Visualization**: Create insightful visualizations to present RFM analysis results, making them accessible and actionable. <br>

# Technologies Used: <br>

**Microsoft SQL Server**: SQL Server was chosen for its robust data processing capabilities, making it suitable for handling and analyzing large sales datasets.

**T-SQL**: Transact-SQL (T-SQL) was used to write SQL queries and scripts for data preprocessing and RFM calculation.

**Data Visualization Tools**: I used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for the results collected by the analysis. <br>
